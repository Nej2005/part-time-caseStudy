# "Part-Time File Management"

A web-based platform designed for the Department Secretary of the College of Computer Studies (CCS) to efficiently organize, upload, manage, and export departmental files such as Daily Time Records (DTR), Accomplishment Reports, and Faculty Schedules. The system includes a secure user account for part-time professors, allowing them to view, upload, and export files shared by the secretary.
